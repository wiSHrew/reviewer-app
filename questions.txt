B. Blood pressure
C. Apical pulse
D. Respiratory rate

Question 8
Which statement by the client indicates that the teaching about the use of a newly prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin for angina has been effective?
A. "I should swallow the tablet immediately when chest pain starts."
B. "I should call emergency services (e.g., 911) if the pain is not relieved after one tablet."
C. "I can take up to four tablets every five minutes until the chest pain is gone."
D. "I should store the medication in a clear container on the windowsill."

Question 9
In the immediate postpartum period, the nurse assesses a client whose fundus is boggy and displaced to the right. What is the priority nursing intervention?
A. Encourage ambulation to the bathroom.
B. Administer pain medication.
C. Massage the uterine fundus.
D. Increase the rate of the IV infusion.

Question 10
A client is scheduled for a procedure requiring informed consent. The nurse's responsibility regarding informed consent is to:

B. Ensure the client understands the information provided by the provider and witness the signature.
C. Inform the client of alternative treatments.
D. Obtain the consent form signature prior to the provider's explanation.

AnswerKey

C. Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is characterized by a classic triad of respiratory distress, neurological impairment (confusion, restlessness), and petechial rash, often occurring 12-72 hours after trauma or orthopedic surgery (like a hip replacement).

B. Epinephrine is the primary and first-line treatment for anaphylaxis due to its vasoconstrictive and bronchodilator properties. Establishing IV access is crucial for rapid medication delivery.

C. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes the excretion of water and electrolytes, leading to increased urine output.

C. Repeated injections in the same site can cause lipodystrophy (atrophy or hypertrophy of subcutaneous fat), which impairs insulin absorption.

C. Removal of gastric acid (which contains Hydrogen and Chloride ions) via NG suction can lead to hypochloremia and a compensatory increase in bicarbonate, resulting in Metabolic Alkalosis.

C. Drooling and inability to swallow in a child with a respiratory illness suggest epiglottitis, which is an airway emergency that can rapidly progress to complete obstruction. Croup typically presents with a bark-like cough and stridor, but drooling is a hallmark of the more severe and emergent epiglottitis.

C. Digoxin slows the heart rate and increases the force of contraction. The apical pulse must be assessed for a full minute, and the medication should be held if the heart rate is below the prescribed cutoff (usually 60 bpm in adults).

B. The standard teaching is to take one dose, wait 5 minutes, and if the pain is not relieved, the client should call emergency services (e.g., 911) and may take a second dose while waiting. A maximum of three doses can be taken 5 minutes apart.

C. A boggy (flaccid) uterus indicates uterine atony, and displacement to the right often indicates a full bladder. The priority in a boggy fundus is to manually massage it to promote contraction and prevent/control postpartum hemorrhage. Then, the nurse should address the full bladder (e.g., encourage voiding or straight catheterization).

B. The nurse's role is to ensure the client-provider communication process is complete, that the client is competent to sign, and to witness the signature. The provider (physician or authorized practitioner) is responsible for explaining the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives.
